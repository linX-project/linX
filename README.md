Release notes for v1.1.0.0
------------------

There was a protocol upgrade in this version which includes important security fixes. All previous wallet versions must be updated to at least v1.1.0.0 as they will no longer be able to connect to the network. This rule came into effect on December 18th 2018 and you can read more about it [here](https://mylinx.io/news/mandatory-wallet-update/).

Build Instructions
------------------

```
cd linX
qmake
make
```

See [docs](https://github.com/linx-project/linx/tree/master/doc) for flags, deps and more info.

If you are running linXd (the daemon) or want to run the Linx Wallet (Qt version)
on the testnet you will need to create a .conf file.

1) Create a blank text file and paste in the following:

```
rpcuser=ChooseAUserName
rpcpassword=ChooseAStrongRandomPassword
addnode=seed.mylinx.io
addnode=testnet.mylinx.io
```

2) Save the file as **linX.conf**

3) Place it inside the following DIR depending on your system:

Windows:

```
/Users/<username>/AppData/Roaming/linX
```
OSX:

```
/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/linX
```
Ubuntu:

```
.linX
```

4) Start Daemon / Wallet


Notes about the compiled Ubuntu binaries
-------------------

This is NOT a static build. It requires external libraries for it to work. If you have built other wallets on your computer before, the chances are that you will already have all of the required libraries. If not see the build [docs](https://github.com/linx-project/linx/tree/master/doc).

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Linx development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch submitter will be asked to start a discussion with the devs and community.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/linx-project/linx/tags) are created regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Linx.
