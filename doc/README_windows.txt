Intro
-----
Linx is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----

- Double click the setup.exe file to install automatically

- Alternatively run linX-qt.exe or linXd.exe without using the installer

linX-Qt is the original Linx client and it builds the backbone of the network.

However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Linx transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the
synchronization process can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.
